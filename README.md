## Expense-Tracker App (MERN)

This is my first MERN app. This is a very simple app where user can input their total expenditure on different items for a month and also input their total income for a month. This app substracts expenditure from income and let you know where you stand interms of finance like whether you were at loss or you made some saving.

# Note :
 This app is very simple as it was my first MERN stack app. I will keep working on this project and will add some more functions during this summer. There are still some parts which could have been better but becuase of time restriction, I could not update them as of now. My goal is to learn more about MERN and Nextjs in future.
